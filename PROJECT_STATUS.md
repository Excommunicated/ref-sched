## 🧪 Testing Coverage

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ OAuth2 login flow
- ✅ Profile creation and editing
- ✅ Referee activation by assignor
- ✅ CSV import with various formats
- ✅ Match editing and cancellation
- ✅ Eligibility rules (age-based and cert-based)
- ✅ Availability marking
- ✅ Assignment workflow (assign/reassign/remove)
- ✅ Conflict detection
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness (Chrome DevTools)

### Test Data
- `test_data/sample_matches.csv` (7 matches, various age groups)
- Multiple test user accounts (assignor + referees)
- Various referee profiles (different ages, cert statuses)

### Known Test Scenarios
1. ✅ New user signup → pending state
2. ✅ Assignor activates pending referee
3. ✅ Referee completes profile
4. ✅ Referee marks availability
5. ✅ Assignor assigns referee to match
6. ✅ Conflict warning when double-booking
7. ✅ Ineligible referee filtered out (age/cert)
8. ✅ Match status updates after assignment

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Timezone handling (times were 9 hours off) → Fixed with timezone=America/New_York in DB connection
- ✅ TIME type timezone conversion → Migrated to TEXT type
- ✅ Alpine Docker missing timezone data → Added tzdata package

### Current Limitations
1. **No Auto-Assignment**: Assignor must manually assign all matches
2. **No Email Notifications**: No emails sent for assignments or changes
3. **No Bulk Operations**: Must assign one role at a time
4. **Last-Write-Wins**: No optimistic locking (acceptable for 1-2 assignors)
5. **Advisory Conflicts**: System doesn't prevent double-booking (shows warning only)
6. **No Undo**: Must manually reverse assignments
7. **Basic Duplicate Detection**: Signal B (date+time+location) not implemented

### Design Decisions (Not Issues)
- **Assignor Can Override Eligibility**: Backend allows any assignment (assignor knows edge cases)
- **TEXT Time Storage**: Avoids PostgreSQL timezone conversion issues
- **Soft Delete**: Removed referees retain data for audit purposes
- **Opt-In Availability**: Referees must explicitly mark availability (default: not available)

3. ⏸️ **Environment Configuration**: Set production env vars
4. ⏸️ **HTTPS Setup**: Configure SSL/TLS certificates
5. ⏸️ **Database Backup**: Configure automated backups
6. ⏸️ **Domain Setup**: Point domain to Azure
7. ⏸️ **Google OAuth Production**: Update redirect URLs for production

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. ✅ **Simple Stack**: Go + SvelteKit + PostgreSQL = easy to understand and maintain
2. ✅ **Incremental Development**: Epic-by-epic approach kept scope manageable
3. ✅ **Migration System**: golang-migrate made schema changes safe and reversible
4. ✅ **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive from day one, no retrofitting needed
5. ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Clean separation between assignor and referee features
6. ✅ **Audit Trail**: Assignment history provides accountability from the start

### Challenges Overcome
1. ✅ **Timezone Handling**: PostgreSQL TIME type caused unexpected conversions → migrated to TEXT
2. ✅ **Docker Alpine**: Missing timezone data → added tzdata package
3. ✅ **Eligibility Complexity**: Multiple rules for different age groups → centralized in eligibility.go
4. ✅ **Modal State Management**: Assignment panel with nested views → two-view design
5. ✅ **CSV Parsing**: Stack Team App format quirks → robust error handling and preview

### Architecture Decisions
1. ✅ **On-the-Fly Eligibility**: Compute at query time (no caching) → always accurate
2. ✅ **Soft Delete**: Retain data for audit purposes
3. ✅ **Advisory Conflicts**: Show warning but allow override → trust assignor judgment
4. ✅ **Session-Based Auth**: Simpler than JWT for this scale
5. ✅ **TEXT Time Storage**: Avoid timezone conversion issues with simple wall-clock times

## ✨ What Makes This Special

This application replaces a **manual, 2-day email-based process** with a **streamlined, 4-hour web-based workflow**:

**Before (Email Process)**:
1. Assignor emails match schedule screenshot to all referees
2. Wait 24-48 hours for availability replies
3. Manually compile replies in spreadsheet
4. Manually assign referees based on availability and eligibility rules
5. Email individual assignments to each referee
6. Wait for acknowledgments
7. Handle cancellations and changes with additional email rounds

**After (This Application)**:
1. Assignor imports CSV from Stack Team App (30 seconds)
2. Referees mark availability in-app (5 minutes each, parallel)
3. Assignor assigns referees with automatic eligibility filtering (15 minutes)
4. Referees see assignments immediately in-app
5. Changes and cancellations update in real-time

**Key Differentiators**:
- ✅ **Automatic Eligibility**: Age and certification rules enforced by system
- ✅ **Conflict Detection**: Warns about double-booking before it happens
- ✅ **Mobile-First**: Referees (including 11-year-olds) use phones primarily
- ✅ **No Email**: 100% in-app communication (except initial signup)
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Full accountability for all assignments
- ✅ **Simple**: Single-developer maintainable, no over-engineering

**🎉 The MVP is FEATURE-COMPLETE and ready for deployment! 🎉**

Only Epic 7 (Azure deployment) remains before production launch.
